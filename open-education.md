# Open Education

Below are aligned educational resources I have been involved in developing:

[Software as a Second Language](https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/2024-global-learning-challenge/solutions/86181): An approach for incrementally adopting comprehension-first programming education designed around four levels of time investment:

1.  **Quick Wins**: Teaching or study techniques you can pick up in under an hour.
2.  **Tools**: Guides for adopting tools like Study Lenses that help understand any code you are working with.
3.  **Content**: Lesson plans, exercises, and references that can be incorporated into an existing curriculum.
4.  **Curriculum**: Guides & resources for redesigning programming curricula around comprehension-first learning objectives.

[De Nepo: Open Ed](https://github.com/DeNepo): A collection of evidence-based resources & tools for computing education. Some highlights:

- [Study Lenses](https://denepo.js.org/study-lenses) ([live site](https://study-lenses.evancole.be), [original app](https://github.com/DeNepo/study-lenses), [spiritual successor](https://github.com/yoshimalaise/Explorotron)): A plugin-based learning environment for generating comprehension exercises from code. The following tutorials are designed for Study Lenses.
- [Welcome to JS](https://github.com/DeNepo/welcome-to-js): A practical introduction to programming focusing on program comprehension and communication skills.
- [Inside JS](https://github.com/DeNepo/inside-js): A deeper look inside JavaScript including expression-level debugging, unit testing, DOM I/O, and reverse-engineering.
- [Behavior, Strategy, Implementation](https://github.com/DeNepo/behavior-strategy-implementation): Explore and practice a wide variety of approaches for solving & reviewing coding challenges.
- [Separation of Concerns](https://github.com/DeNepo/separation-of-concerns): Learn how to plan and collaborate on a software project with code-splitting and file/folder conventions based on the code's role in the program.

[InTechgration](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/): I am helping them to adopt/adapt De Nepo materials, and giving Instructional design & curriculum packaging advice for [WDX-180](https://github.com/in-tech-gration/WDX-180)

[Blocks to Text](https://github.com/blocks-to-text/top): Thoughts about helping learners transition from blocks to text. Also an experiment in hosting essays+slides+demos in one GitHub organization.

[JS for Open Computing Education](https://archive.fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/js_teaching_tool/). A presentation from FOSDEM '19 with some principles for designing realistically open computing education. The code is wonky, the ideas are solid.

- [slides](https://evancole.be/fosdem-2019/index.html#/), [repo](https://github.com/colevandersWands/fosdem-2019) (forked because I accidentally deleted mine ðŸ¤¦)

[Micromaterials](https://github.com/lpmi-13/micromaterials-list): Open learning resources that are focused, free, give automated feedback, and (ideally) generate endless practice.

- [DevEdOps Dimensions](https://micromaterialsblog.wordpress.com/2024/03/25/devedops-dimensions/) by [Adam](https://github.com/lpmi-13/)
- [presented at FOSDEM '23](https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/breaking_code_of_inclusion/) by [Yoshi](https://github.com/yoshimalaise/)
