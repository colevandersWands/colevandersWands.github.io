I'm curious how we can translate research in computing education to open tools, content and practices:

â†’ _How can we balance speed and rigor to best serve learners and educators?_

## [Open Education](./open-education.md)

AI can now write and explain code, but people still need to understand and maintain this code. To adapt, programming education must center code comprehension, discussion, and review instead of code writing. Research finds this is also the most effective way to learn programming, with or without access to AI.

If we want programming education to stay relevant and open doors to opportunity, we need a new open philosophy of programming education that centers comprehension-first learning, peer-led study, easy content authoring, and offline study.

## [Research](./research.md)

I create methods and tools for research translation in computing education, helping promising advances in research reach learners and educators everywhere. My specialty is translating findings and prototypes from CER into classroom-ready prototypes for adult technical education.

## [Work](./work.md)

Evidence-based instructional design is key to operating an efficient programming course. I can help you reduce costs while still improving learner outcomes by adjusting learning objectives to avoid common challenges, by using educators' time more effectively, by promoting structured collaboration in class, and by advising strategic investments in content.

I've always loved language, linguistics and reading more than I liked playing on computers. So when I program I think more about the writing, the language and the rhetorics than what I'm building. I also think [rhetorical situations](https://evancole.be/notes/#/page/rhetorics-first%20curriculum%20design) are [a great starting point](https://github.com/DeNepo/welcome-to-js/tree/main/1-what-is-programming) for [teaching programming](https://github.com/DeNepo/class-repository/tree/main/guides#what-is-programming).

My main computery hobby is [snippetry](https://snippetry.evancole.be/?danger=yes) â†’ _What can you do with under 40(ish) lines at a time?_

[If Hemingway Wrote JavaScript](https://anguscroll.com/hemingway/) has influenced my programming life more than any other single source. [How to Draw a Bunny](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/beautiful-javascript/9781449371142/ch03.html) is in second place.

I recently discovered [coem-lang](https://www.coem-lang.org/) and [Dwitter](https://www.dwitter.net/u/etc.ole).
