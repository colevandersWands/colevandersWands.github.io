# Fun

I've always loved language, linguistics and reading more than I liked playing on computers. So when I program I think more about the writing, the language and the rhetorics than what I'm building. I also think [rhetorical situations](https://evancole.be/notes/#/page/rhetorics-first%20curriculum%20design) are [a great starting point](https://github.com/DeNepo/welcome-to-js/tree/main/1-what-is-programming) for [teaching programming](https://github.com/DeNepo/class-repository/tree/main/guides#what-is-programming).

My main computery hobby is [snippetry](https://evancole.be/snippetry/?danger=yes) â†’ \_What can you do with under 40(ish) lines at a time?\_ Let's talk, together we can build things we could never imagine alone.

[If Hemingway Wrote JavaScript](https://anguscroll.com/hemingway/) has influenced my programming life more than any other single source. [How to Draw a Bunny](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/beautiful-javascript/9781449371142/ch03.html) is in second place.

I recently discovered [coem-lang](https://www.coem-lang.org/) and [Dwitter](https://www.dwitter.net/u/etc.ole).
